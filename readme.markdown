# Open Source RDBMS

The following lecture was made and given for Non profit organization named [Iltam](http://www.iltam.org/).

## The lecture

The lecture created for teaching technical managers about Open source RDBMS, and I choose 7 common databases for it.
There are many more Open Sourced RDBMS, that I was unable to add, and I know that they should be mentioned in other
lectures.

The lecture emphasis on:

  * What is RDBMS (in general)
  * Key information regarding each RDBMS
  * Small tip on what/how to choose a RDBMS
