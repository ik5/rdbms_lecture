                In the beginning there was a lot of data, and people wanted to store it
                in files, and retrieve it when needed.

                Some of the data had a use with other existed data, but no one wanted to store the same data twice.

            <blockquote>Formally, a "database" refers to a set of related data and the way it is organized. Access to this data is usually provided by a "database management system" (DBMS) consisting of an integrated set of computer software that allows users to interact with one or more databases and provides access to all of the data contained in the database (although restrictions may exist that limit access to particular data). The DBMS provides various functions that allow entry, storage and retrieval of large quantities of information and provides ways to manage how that information is organized.</blockquote>

            Apache Derby (used to be IBM Cloudscape), is both embedded and server RDBMS.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Original creator is Nat Wyatt from Cloudscape Inc. The first release named JBMS back in 1997.<br>

            In 1999 Informix Software Inc bought Cloudscape Inc. In 2001 IBM acquired the database from Informix
            Software.

            The database was re-brand by IBM as "IBM Cloudscape" and released as embedded Java database, as part of
            IBM's Java stack.

          <p>
            On 25 of July, 2000 the company Borland released their database engine - Interbase v6.0 as open source. <br>
            A week later, a new project was created named Firebird using Interbase v6.0 as their engine.

        <section>
          <p>
            On 11 March 2002 Firebird v1.0 was released, as independent database, supporting multiple operating systems
            such as Linux, Windows, Mac and other Unix flavors, that were given support two months later.
          </p>
        </section>

            A massive porting of the database was made from C to C++, and on 23 February 2004, Firebird 1.5 was

            Two Berkeley scientist - Michael Stonebraker and Eugene Wong read the papers, and started working on a
            relational database research project named University INGRES.

        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            In 1982, Michael Stonebraker left Berkeley to make a proprietary version for INGRES.

        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            On 1985 Michael Stonebraker returned to  Berkeley and started to work on a post-INGRES project to address
            issues found on the database design.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>

            The project was named Post<del>in</del>Gres. The new implementation try to "understand" relationship, and
            could retrieve information in related tables using rules.

        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            Postgres used ideas from INGRES but did not used it's code.

        <section>
          <p>
            On 1989 version 1 of Postgres was released, on 1990 version 2 and on 1991 version 3.<br>
            Version 2 and 3 rewrote how the rule system worked, and added support for multiple storage managers.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>On 1994, after version 4 was done, Berkeley had release Postgres under an MIT like license, that helped other
            developers to use the code for any use case they desire.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            Version 4 also supported POSTQUEL query language interpreter, and a cli tool named monitor to interact with
            the engine.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            In 1994, Berkeley graduate students Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen replaced the POSTQUEL query language
            interpreter with one for the SQL query language, creating Postgres95.<br><br>
            The front-end program monitor was also
            replaced by psql. Yu and Chen announced the first version (0.01) to beta testers on May 5, 1995.

            On July 8, 1996, Marc Fournier at Hub.org Networking Services provided the first non-university development
            server for the open-source development effort.<br><br>
            With the participation of Bruce Momjian and Vadim B. Mikheev, work began to stabilize the code inherited from Berkeley.

        <section>
          <p>
            In 1996, the project was renamed to PostgreSQL to reflect its support for SQL.<br><br>
            The online presence at the website PostgreSQL.org began on October 22, 1996.
